Fix building of cmoc-os9 floating point code or at least printf code; partly done needs tested.
Under CygWin get first vbcc0_9hP2 and then vbcc0_9hP3 to build; next under msys2
Upgrade vbcc; likely requires source code changes
Convert mame-tools into msys2 package; wait till it builds under Cygwin
Convert cc65 into msys2 package
Create git repo for gcc6502 and gcc6 msys2 packages
Test gcc6809lw works with hello world code
